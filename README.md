The code is properly formatted with syntax highlighting (using monospace font)

**2.Improved UI for Code Display:**

Code section appears below the explanation

Only one code language can be active at a time

The active code language button is highlighted

**3.Comprehensive Code Examples:**

Added appropriate code examples for all three languages

Proper handling of mathematical operations in each language

Includes necessary imports and boilerplate code

**4.Better User Experience:**

Code is only shown after an explanation is generated

Users can switch between different programming languages

The code display updates when the calculation changes

This enhanced calculator now provides explanations in multiple languages and also shows code implementations in Python, Java, and C, making it a valuable tool for both learning mathematics and programming.
